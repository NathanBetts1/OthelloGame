 #The Board:
As per the specifications of the assignment I chose to use a two-dimensional array in which to store the Game tokens. Are used nested loops carefully in order to achieve the grid like game, user interface. I Nisha lies to the board using the function by filling the content of the two-dimensional arrive with spaces unless the middle for squares were detected through the ith and jth positions and then a white or a black token was placed.

I am from is another function called print function which just duplicated the initialising of the board with the current value is in the array.

Using the use of selected row and column positions I would implement a series of checks using loops in which the eye and J values would be bro plus one row -1 et cetera in order to check all positions 360° around the selected position to check if the move is a valid one.
It’s a valid move detected a return value of one would be returned otherwise a value of -1 then if a valid move was detected a flip function will be called in order to turn the opposite players discs between a detected current player’s disc and their chosen position.

#The Players
For the players I implemented a very basic structure in which values for the players name and their current score or allocated. Are used a get score function in which to scan the entire Ray and allocate the players scores depending on how many of their respective tokens were on the board.

#Game Over 
And check if the game is over I scan the board to see if there doesn’t exist or white space if there is and I set the game overvalue to one terminating the program bow but I print out the winter there score and then to the file with as mentioned in the specification of the program the current time and winner’s name and score are sent to the file.
